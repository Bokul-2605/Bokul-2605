# Hi 👋 I'm Bokul

🎓 B.Tech Student | 💻 Developer | 🎨 Creative Thinker  

I enjoy turning imagination into working software.  
As a B.Tech student, I am constantly learning and experimenting with new ideas — building web applications, designing APIs, and writing clean Python code.

I believe creativity is not just for design — it belongs in logic, architecture, and problem solving too.

## 🧠 What Makes Me Different

I combine technical learning with creative thinking.  
I like imagining how systems should behave before building them.  

For me, coding is not only about syntax —  
it is about designing ideas carefully and turning them into structured solutions.
