<h1 align="center">Hey There 👋, I'm Bokul;</h1>

  <em>I see software as architecture drawn in logic.</em>

## 🧠 Who Am I?

I am a B.Tech student who approaches code with structure and intention.

Before I build, I imagine.
Before I write, I design.

Creativity is not decoration.
It is disciplined problem solving.

## ⚙️ My Creative Toolkit

I focus less on tools,  
and more on how they connect.

## 🎨 Philosophy

Creativity is not decoration.  
It is problem solving.

Good software is not loud.  
It is intentional.
