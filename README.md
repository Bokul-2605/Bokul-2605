  <em>Turning imagination into structured systems.</em>
</p>

---

## 🧠 Who Am I?

I am a B.Tech student who sees code as architecture.

Some people write programs.  
I prefer designing systems.

Imagination is my starting point.  
Structure is my discipline.  
Execution is my craft.

---

## ⚙️ My Creative Toolkit

I focus less on tools,  
and more on how they connect.

## 🧩 Current Obsession

- Designing APIs that feel clean and logical  
- Building interfaces that feel intentional  
- Improving system thinking  
- Writing code that is readable six months later

## 🎨 Philosophy

Creativity is not decoration.  
It is problem solving.

Good software is not loud.  
It is intentional.
